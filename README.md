# vsfm_util
simple python socket interface to VSFM

Most of the functionality provided is untested outside of those used within the test script

After you've setup VSFM, you can test this by setting the path to the VSFM bin in
test_vsfm_socket_util.py, and then running
    python test_vsfm_socket_util.py
